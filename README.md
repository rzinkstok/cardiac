CARDIAC
=======

Implementation of the CARDboard Illustrative Aid to Computation (see 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARDboard_Illustrative_Aid_to_Computation).

This implementation leans heavily on the work of Kevin Veroneau (see 
http://www.pythondiary.com/blog/Oct.15,2014/building-cpu-simulator-python.html) 
and the information found on https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html.
